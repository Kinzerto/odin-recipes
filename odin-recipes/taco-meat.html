    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup finely chopped onion</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons taco seasoning, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 Â½ pounds ground round</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li> Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook, breaking up clumps with a spatula, until fat renders out and beef begins to brown, about 4 minutes. Add onion and cook, stirring constantly until onion is softened and beef is crumbly, about 4 minutes. Drain fat if desired. </li>
        <li> Add desired amount of taco seasoning and cook 1 minute. Add in tomato paste and water and cook, using a spoon to loosen any browned bits from the pan, and stir until well combined. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
